  <p class="body-text">
    In conclusion, our project has comprehensively addressed the three types of diabetes, elucidating their causes, symptoms, and treatments. We've provided insights into prevalent factors influencing these types, including glucose levels, insulin resistance, age, BMI, and the number of pregnancies. By exploring these multifaceted aspects, we aim to enhance understanding and awareness surrounding diabetes. We believe that our interactive approach fosters a deeper comprehension of this complex condition, ultimately contributing to improved management and prevention strategies in tackling the diabetes epidemic.
