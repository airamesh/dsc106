    Did you know that recently, the average age of diabetes onset has reduced, indicating a concerning trend of the disease affecting individuals at younger ages? Diabetes is a major public health issue in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and placing a significant burden on the healthcare system. The prevalence of diabetes has been rising steadily, driven by factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and increasing obesity rates. This project aims to provide an interactive and insightful look into the diabetes epidemic through various visualizations that explore different aspects of the disease, including its types, demographic impacts, and the relationship with lifestyle factors. We plan on using markers like number of pregnancies, age, blood sugar levels, BMI levels, blood pressure, skin thickness etc to draw a clearer picture of the relationship between diabetes and the various factors that affect it.
