    Diabetes is a major public health issue in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and placing a significant burden on the healthcare system. The prevalence of diabetes has been rising steadily, driven by factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and increasing obesity rates. There are multiple reasons why someone might suffer from diabetes, including genetics and life experiences such as pregnancy, factors we are not always aware of. Our motivation for creating this website was to provide a platform where basic information about diabetes could be showcased interactively. This project aims to offer an interactive and insightful exploration of the diabetes epidemic through various visualizations that delve into different aspects of the disease, including its types, demographic impacts, and lifestyle changes. To achieve this, we are examining variables such as age, insulin and glucose levels, and number of pregnancies.
